# library_to_samplesheet

A simple package to convert library sheets used for NextSeq runs to sample
 sheets suitable for bcl2fastq.
 
Also contains a `Dockerfile` for bcl2fastq conversion and script for it's end-to-end operation.

Not a general purpose process - meant to work only for our specific use case.
